      <description>What are they? Matters? ðŸ¤”ðŸ†˜ Data Race and Race Condition are DIFFERENT
Data-Race â†’ MORE than 1 thread access to shared-resource (can be a variable or object) and AT LEAST 1 thread tries to modify that resource Race-Condition â†’ Order of threads&amp;rsquo; execution leads to wrong program behavior Many race conditions are due to data races, and many data races lead to race conditions. Can have race conditions without data races and data races without race conditions.</description>
